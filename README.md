# About

dashQL is a lightweight GraphQL caching tool utilizing Redis to cache queries at the field level to further improve reponse time and decrease the number of redundant requests required

# Features
* Allows for caching at the field level from the GraphQL abstract syntax tree
* Ability to handle query requests both with and without an argument
* Ability to cache deeply nested queries
  

# Getting Started
1. Install redis and define host and port in server file
  ```Javascript
const redisClient = redis.createClient({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 6379,
});
```
2. Download dashQL as an npm module and save it to your package.json as a dependency 
```Javascript
npm install dashQL
```
3. Import dashQL into server file
```Javascript
const dashQL = require('dashQL');
```
4. Create an instance of dashQL by passing in redisClient in server file

```Javascript
const dashQL = new dashQL(redisClient);
```

5. On your server file which handles graphQL requests, name the endpoint '/dashQL' and put in dashQL as your middleware and return res.locals back to client

```Javascript
app.use('/dashQL', dashQL, (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  return res.status(200).send(res.locals);
});
```

6. Enjoy significantly faster response times specifically at the field level not just per query string!

 

# Demo
Feel free to visit our website to get an interactive demonstration of how our caching tool works and view the significantly improved response times

After entering our site, you will be met with a demonstration with the ability to run GraphQL queries with an interactive selection tool utilizing the Star Wars API.

1. Select the fields you would like to query and a preview of the GraphQL query will be shown

2. Click the 'Run Query' button to see the GraphQL query result. The metrics above will show the uncached response time populated on the graph and a cache hit/miss result will be logged to the bar charts. A cache miss will be logged the first time a unique query is run indicating that the query was not found in our cache and will be stored.

3. This time, select an additional field to query. Then click the 'Run Query' button. The response time has drastically decreased as the previous field level queries were stored in the cache and the server only has to go to the database for one field.

4. Feel free to play around with nested queries by selecting 'Species' or queries without an '_id' argument.

In this last example, you will notice the response time is decreased even further on the third query request as now all information is coming from the cache. 

5. Lastly, click the 'Clear Cache' button to clear the cache and start over.
